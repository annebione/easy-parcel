# Easy Parcel
Shipments made easy. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run npm install:

```bash
npm install
```

Then init the db:

```bash
npm run db:init
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Improvements

1. Form validation
2. Account creation
3. Better data modeling so users can keep track of their labels, and we can store more shipment/address/parcel data
4. Better component encapsulation/decoupling (especially when it comes to deciding on server/client components)
5. Loading/Error states
